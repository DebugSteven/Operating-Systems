Compiled with GCC 4.8.2

Source Files:
program1.cpp - the main file that sets up functions to run correctly
program1functions.cpp - implementation to send commands and arguments to be executed by the system
program1functions.h - has the prototypes for the functions that execute system calls

Command line input needs to be:
command
command -argument
command > file
command -argument > file
command < file
command argument < file

It displays an error message when the command cannot be found based off the filepath.

Change directory command does not work and I have no error checking for if the typed command has errors.
If you type a command that is partially correct it will try to run and it will not exit.
So the exit command would need to be used to exit all running children as well as the parent.
